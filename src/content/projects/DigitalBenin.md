<!-- Project overview -->
Digital Benin aggregates data on over 5,000 objects held across 138 institutions in 20 countries, tracing the global dispersal of artefacts looted from the Benin Kingdom in 1897. The platform links object records with provenance data, historical context, oral histories, and an Edo language catalogue. Using linked, unedited source metadata, it integrates maps, metadata, and multilingual sources to offer a centralized, searchable resource that visualizes the worldwide movement and current locations of Benin’s royal artworks and related materials.

</div>

Focusing on key historical sites and landmarks in Edo South, formerly the Benin Kingdom, this map highlights Benin City and surrounding towns. It traces how political and cultural structures were shaped by geography, like the city’s radial street plan and guild‑based wards. Sites span centuries, reflecting the deep, place‑based history of the Kingdom’s evolving social and urban landscape.

Offering a global view of Benin cultural objects, especially the Benin Bronzes, this map shows where they are held today. It contrasts their current locations with their original context in the Kingdom of Benin. By mapping global dispersion, it reflects the impact of colonial looting and the ongoing legacy of displacement, ownership, and restitution surrounding these significant cultural works.

<h2>Ẹyo Otọ: Historical objects with their correct Edo designation</h2>

    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"
    title="DB Eye Oto EXPORT LF"
  ></iframe>
</div>

Ẹyo Otọ restructures museum collection data by reclassifying objects using original Edo designations. It integrates visual, written, and spoken descriptions, enabling multi‑modal access. Users can view, download, and interact with illustrations as coloring books or language cards. The platform addresses data gaps and supports Edo‑led knowledge production by embedding cultural, linguistic, and historical context.

    title="DB Graph Provenance ORIGINAL"
  ></iframe>
</div>

Linking roles, names, and acquisition histories across 138 institutions and 959 provenances, users can sort by provenance, institution, object count, or country, and view detailed collection overviews. Bar graphs visualize record counts for comparative analysis, while consistent metadata links enable cross‑institutional research into provenance, collection histories, and the global movement of Benin objects.

    title="DB Catalogue ORIGINAL NEW"
  ></iframe>
</div>

The Digital Benin catalogue allows users to search, filter, and study over 5,000 objects from 138 institutions. It links object data with Edo and English designations, provenance, and categories, preserving institutional metadata structures. Filters enable dynamic research into object relationships, institutions, and provenance networks. Object cards display search results, and data includes images, 3D scans, and contextual research.
