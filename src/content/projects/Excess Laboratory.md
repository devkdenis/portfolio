<!-- Project overview -->
<div class="project">
  <b>Surplus storage beyond efficiency</b>: 
  Excess has become a driving force of technological advancements and the complex serialization processes that regulate digital and material information. Storage and distribution centers have become important mediators between producers and consumers, exacerbating the proliferation of surplus (or excess) and simplifying transactions. Hyper-consumerism (a relatively new escalation in consumerism, which has reached an abnormal intensity that far surpasses its earlier forms) is the accelerated progression of the production, consumption and discarding of excess resources. Today, the instant gratification of disowning-the-old runs in parallel with the instant gratification of owning-the-new, a process which on one hand legitimizes the production of excess, while on the other prevents overproduction.

  ##### The relationship between the three words (waste, storage, and memory) were initially explored during my last option studio (Networked Urbanism: Urban Waste), an experimental online platform that aims to allow material at the Harvard Recycling and Surplus Center to become accessible to more people while forming a collective memory to reveal the potential value of items. This thesis was an attempt to continue exploring these three critical terms in the context of a world where the rapid evolution of technology, consumption and waste continue to be underestimated urban conditions.
