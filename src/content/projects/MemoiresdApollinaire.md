<!-- Project overview -->
The French poet, playwright, novelist, journalist, and art critic Guillaume Apollinaire produced prodigiously during his short life (1880-1918). Today, Apollinaire’s playful forms of expression continue to inspire manifold interpretation in digital form, in video, song, and even dance. Despite this, much of his work still lay dormant, dispersed in archives across Paris, accessible mostly to academics. Memoires d'Apollinaire centralizes a large portion of his impressive oeuvre and makes it explorable for high school students in classrooms throughout France.

This platform encourages students to explore Apollinaire’s influence by placing his works amidst the modern artifacts which they have inspired. To this end, the project reveals a network of thousands of diverse media objects – manuscripts, texts, newspapers, audio clips, videos, and photographs. So while Apollinaire only lived to thirty-six, on Project Apollinaire the timeline of his influence extends visually into the present day.

This experimental visualization maps Guillaume Apollinaire’s poem Zone (1913, Alcools) as a navigable web interface. The tool moves through the text line by line, emphasizing shifts in time and place. It explores how spatial presentation can offer new ways to experience and interpret the structure and flow of the poem.
