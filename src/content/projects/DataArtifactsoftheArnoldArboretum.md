<!-- Project overview -->
"In collections of scientific and cultural history that are too big to see, metadata act as virtual handles for rare and delicate artifacts from the past. At the Arnold Arboretum, a long-lived collection of trees, vines and shrubs managed by Harvard University, landscapes from around the world and across time are stitched together by metadata. However, metadata are worthy of study themselves. Created in varied social and technological eras, they register the organizational structures and values of their time. Through a combination of data visualization and interviews with Arboretum staff, this essay illuminates what metadata can teach us about their own social and material histories, as well as how to study collections digitally." - Excerpt from Yanni Loukissas’s text (<a href="http://lifeanddeathofdata.org/" target="_blank">lifeanddeathofdata.org</a>)

The Life and Death of Data is an interactive research paper that invites users to explore the Arnold Arboretum’s plant accessions through a temporal data visualization, presented alongside Yanni Loukissas’s written research. The paper activates and highlights elements within the visualization, while key moments in the visualization scroll users to the corresponding sections of the text for contextual insight. The result is a dynamic interplay between visual and textual narratives, designed to be experienced in tandem.

Category: Map, Installation<br><br>
The <a href="http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/data-resources/" target="_blank">Arnold Arboretum accessions data</a> was geographically explored by plotting their source addresses (psources). These points, each containing one or multiple plants, do not indicate origins but instead from where accessions were retrieved. Many of these sources are plant nurseries. In the interactive version users can geographically explore the Arboretum’s plant accessions.<br><br>
Green = a plant collected from the wild<br>
Yellow = a cutting from a plant collected from the wild<br>
Black = a cultivated plant<br>
Grey = a plant from an unknown origin<br>
Shaded areas = number of plants per location
