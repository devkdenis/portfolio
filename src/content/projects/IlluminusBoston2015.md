<!-- Project overview -->
<div class="project">
  <a href="https://illuminus.org" target="_blank">Illuminus Boston</a> is a public festival celebrating light, art, and technology. It transforms urban spaces with projection mapping, sculptural installations, and interactive performances. The event features local artists who create multimedia works exploring themes of community, memory, and place, turning Boston’s streets into spaces for reflection and connection. In 2015, metaLAB’s A bit in the abyss installation was accepted and exhibited as part of the festival.

  ### A bit in the abyss
  
  ##### <i>A bit in the abyss</i>, presented at <a href="https://illuminus.org/illuminus-2015/abitintheabyss" target="_blank">Illuminus Boston</a>, is a digital storage server housed in a shipping container. Sonified data processing mirrors the expansion of server hosts, while reflective surfaces amplify blinking lights to create an immersive, prismatic effect. Referencing mise‑en‑abyme, the design evokes an infinite loop that suggests the existential weight and abstraction of digitized knowledge.
